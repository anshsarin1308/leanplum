# Project setup

- Use Node.js version 14.19.0

- To set up the project dependencies, run `yarn install`.

- To run a development server that compiles and hot-reloads, use `yarn serve`.

- To run the unit tests, use `yarn test:unit`.

- To lint and fix style issues, use `yarn lint`.


### Requirements

- Bind the list to the sample data provided in `src/models/UsersEntity.ts`.

- Selecting an item from the list should display its details in a side panel (or tooltip or modal).


### Styling

Let's say that our designers work with [Abstract](https://www.abstract.com/home) that provides a style inspector to quickly find the colors and sizes used in a design. For the sake of the project, we've extracted the required colors and styles in the below list.

#### Fonts

- Title: `16px`
- Subtitle: `12px`
- User ID (in list): `14px` bold
- User ID (in details): `18px` bold
- Tile title: `12px`
- Tile value: `18px` bold

#### Colors

- Subtitle color: `#b2b7b9`
- Tile background: `#f6f9fb`
- Tile title color: `#b2b7b9`
- Table border color: `#e1e4e5`
- Table header color: `#b2b7b9`

### Spacing

Our design system uses `4px`, `8px`, `16px`, or `24px`.

### Other

Border radius is `4px`.

Box shadow: `0 8px 20px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`
